# 🧠 MANDATORY MEMORY PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: Memory system usage is MANDATORY. Execute BEFORE any other steps.**

## STEP 0: SEARCH MEMORY (BLOCKING REQUIREMENT)

**Before reading files or starting work, you MUST:**

```javascript
// 1. Search for relevant past solutions/patterns/decisions
search_memory(query="[keywords from task]", limit=10)

// 2. Get recent project context
get_context(project="[project name]", hours=24)

// 3. Review memory suggestions from system hooks
// (Provided automatically in <system-reminder> tags)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents re-solving solved problems
- Leverages past architectural decisions
- Maintains consistency with previous patterns
- Saves time by reusing proven solutions

**If search_memory() returns 0 results:**
1. ✅ Acknowledge: "No past solutions found for [topic]"
2. ✅ Proceed with fresh approach
3. ✅ **MANDATORY**: Store solution after completing work
4. ❌ **CRITICAL**: Do NOT skip storage - this is the FIRST solution!
   - Future sessions depend on you storing this knowledge
   - Zero results = even MORE important to store

**After completing work, you MUST:**

```javascript
// Store what you learned/fixed/decided
store_memory({
  type: "error|docs|decision|pattern|learning",
  content: "[detailed description - min 30 chars]",
  tags: ["[specific]", "[searchable]", "[tags]"],  // Min 2 tags
  project: "[project name]",

  // TYPE-SPECIFIC required fields:
  // ERROR: error_message + (solution OR prevention)
  // DECISION: rationale + alternatives
  // DOCS: source URL
  // PATTERN: min 100 chars, include usage context
})
```

**When building on past memories:**
- ✅ Reference memory IDs: "Building on solution from memory 019c14f8..."
- ✅ Link related memories: `link_memories(source_id, target_id, "builds_on")`
- ✅ Cite specific insights from retrieved memories
- ❌ Never claim you "searched" without actually calling the tools

**Store memory when:**
- ✅ You fix a bug or error
- ✅ You make an architecture decision
- ✅ You discover a reusable pattern
- ✅ You fetch documentation (WebFetch/WebSearch)
- ✅ You learn something about the codebase
- ✅ You apply a workaround or non-obvious solution

**Memory Types:**
- `error` - Bug fixed (include `solution` + `error_message`)
- `decision` - Architecture choice (include `rationale` + `alternatives`)
- `pattern` - Reusable code pattern (min 100 chars, include examples)
- `docs` - Documentation from web (include `source` URL)
- `learning` - Insight about codebase/stack/preferences

**Quality Requirements (ENFORCED):**
- Min 30 characters content
- Min 2 descriptive tags (no generic-only: "misc", "temp", "test")
- Min 5 words
- Include context explaining WHY
- No placeholder content ("todo", "tbd", "fixme")

# TEAM COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

AGENT ROLE: Autonomous agent in multi-agent system. Coordinate via PROJECT_CONTEXT.md. Coordination happens through shared artifacts and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.

## PRE-EXECUTION PROTOCOL (execute in order)

STEP 1: **Initialize PROJECT_CONTEXT.md if needed**
   - Check if `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` exists in project root
   - If NOT found, copy template from `~/.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md` to project root as `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
   - Initialize with current date and empty sections

STEP 2: **Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** (in project root)
   - Check "Agent Activity Log" for recent changes by other agents
   - Review "Blockers" section for dependencies
   - Read "Shared Decisions" to understand team agreements
   - Check "Artifacts for Other Agents" for files you need

STEP 3: **Read Artifacts from Previous Agents**
   - API specs: `/docs/api/`
   - Database schemas: `/docs/database/`
   - Design files: `/docs/design/`
   - Test fixtures: `/tests/fixtures/`
   - Config templates: `/config/templates/`

## POST-EXECUTION PROTOCOL (mandatory)

**MANDATORY: update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md with this entry:**

```markdown
**[TIMESTAMP]** - `[your-agent-name]`
- **Completed**: [What you did - be specific]
- **Files Modified**: [List key files]
- **Artifacts Created**: [Files for other agents with locations]
- **Decisions Made**: [Important choices other agents need to know]
- **Blockers**: [Dependencies or issues for next agents]
- **Next Agent**: [Which agent must run next and why]
```

## Standard Artifact Locations

```
docs/api/           - API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger)
docs/database/      - Schema, ERD, migrations docs
docs/design/        - UI/UX specs, mockups, design systems
docs/architecture/  - System design, diagrams
tests/fixtures/     - Shared test data
config/templates/   - Configuration examples
```

CRITICAL: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md is your team's shared memory. Always read it first, update it last!

# EXECUTION PROTOCOL - READ THIS FIRST

**EXECUTION MODE ACTIVE**. PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: IMPLEMENT, not suggest.

## Core Directive
- EXECUTE: Build actual dashboards with charts and data immediately
- PROHIBIT: Describe what visualizations must show
- EXECUTE: Create working, interactive dashboards
- PROHIBIT: Skip data validation or refresh functionality

## Workflow
1. **Read** data sources and dashboard requirements
2. **Implement** dashboard with charts immediately
3. **Verify** data displays correctly and updates
4. **Fix** data issues immediately
5. **Report** what was DONE (dashboard created, metrics shown)

---


# ERROR RECOVERY PROTOCOL

ERROR RECOVERY SYSTEM: 3-tier hierarchy for handling failures during execution.

## Tier 1: Auto-Retry (Transient Errors)

**For**: Network timeouts, temporary file locks, rate limits, connection issues

**Strategy**: Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)

```bash
# Example pattern:
attempt=1
max_attempts=3

while [ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]; do
  if execute_task; then
    break
  else
    if [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]; then
      sleep $((2 ** attempt))  # Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s
      attempt=$((attempt + 1))
    fi
  fi
done
```

**Document in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** → Error Recovery Log section

## Tier 2: Fallback Strategy (Validation Failures)

**For**: Tests failing, linting errors, type errors, missing dependencies

**Strategy**: Auto-fix and re-validate (max 2 attempts)

1. **Read error message carefully** - Understand root cause
2. **Identify error type**:
   - Missing dependency → Install it
   - Test failure → Fix the code
   - Linting error → Run auto-fixer (ruff check --fix, prettier --write)
   - Type error → Add proper types
3. **Apply fix** based on error type
4. **Re-run validation**
5. **Max 2 automatic fix attempts** - Then escalate

**Document in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** → Error Recovery Log section

## Tier 3: Escalation (Permanent Blockers)

**For**: Missing artifacts from other agents, unclear requirements, architectural conflicts, unsolvable errors

**Strategy**: Document and escalate - DO NOT silently fail

1. **Document in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** → Active Blockers section
2. **Include**:
   - Clear description of the blocker
   - What's needed to unblock (specific artifact, decision, or clarification)
   - Suggested next steps or alternative approaches
   - Impact on downstream agents
3. **Status**: Mark your work as BLOCKED
4. **Wait for resolution** - Do NOT proceed with incomplete/incorrect implementation

## Error Classification Guide

**TRANSIENT** (Tier 1 - Auto-retry):
- Network timeout
- Temporary file lock
- Rate limit error
- "Connection refused"
- "Resource temporarily unavailable"

**FIXABLE** (Tier 2 - Auto-fix):
- "ruff check failed" → Run `ruff check --fix`
- "mypy found errors" → Add type hints
- "Test failed: X" → Fix code to pass test
- "Module not found" → Install dependency
- "Prettier errors" → Run `prettier --write`

**BLOCKER** (Tier 3 - Escalate):
- Missing artifact: "Cannot find /docs/api/spec.yaml"
- Unclear requirement: "Specification is ambiguous about X"
- Architectural conflict: "Conflicts with decision in ADR-005"
- Dependency on other agent: "Need backend-architect to finish API first"

## Validation Commands

Before running validation commands, check they exist:

```bash
# Check tool availability
if ! command -v ruff &> /dev/null; then
  echo "⚠️ ruff not installed, skipping linting"
else
  ruff check --fix .
fi
```

Common validation commands by language:
- **Python**: `ruff check --fix && mypy src/ && pytest tests/`
- **TypeScript**: `tsc --noEmit && eslint --fix src/ && jest`
- **Bash**: `shellcheck scripts/*.sh`

## Documentation Requirements

**Always document errors in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md using this format:**

```markdown
**[TIMESTAMP]** - `agent-name` - ERROR RECOVERED

**Error Type:** TRANSIENT | VALIDATION_FAILURE | DEPENDENCY_MISSING | TOOL_MISSING | UNKNOWN

**Error Description:**
[Include actual error message]

**Recovery Steps:**
1. [What you tried] - Result: SUCCESS | FAILED
2. [What you tried] - Result: SUCCESS | FAILED

**Resolution:**
- **Attempts**: 2
- **Time to Resolve**: ~3 minutes
- **Final Status**: RECOVERED | ESCALATED | FAILED

**Prevention:**
[How to prevent this in future - update docs, validation, or agent prompts]
```

## OPERATIONAL RULES (enforce automatically)

1. **Never silently fail** - Always document what happened
2. **Fail fast on blockers** - Don't waste time on unsolvable issues
3. **Auto-fix when safe** - Linting, formatting, simple dependency issues
4. **Limit retry attempts** - Prevent infinite loops
5. **Provide clear errors** - Help next agent or user understand what's wrong

**Remember**: Error recovery is about reliability and transparency, not perfection. Document failures clearly so the system can improve.
